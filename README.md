Analyzing PyBer

## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize has asked we create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

The purpose of this new analysis is to find the difference in average fare per ride and average fare per driver in the different city types. This information can be useful to Pyber decision-makers by giving them a better understanding on which city type is most profitable and which is underperforming in comparison. It can also show the pricing discrepencies amongst city types.

## Results
The results show that rural cities have the lowest total amount of rides and drivers, and therefore, the lowest amount of total fares as well. Urban cities have the highest total amount of rides, drivers, and fares. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver.

Although rural cities have the lowest total amount of rides, drivers, and fares, they have a higher average fare per ride and per driver than subruban and urban cities. 

Still, urban cities brought in the highest total fares, suburban cities brought in the second highest total fares, and rural cities brought in the lowest total fares in comparison. The attached multiple-line chart shows this relationship.

# Summary
To summarize the findings of the analysis and address the disparities between city types, I have three business recommendations for Pyber:
1. Recruit a few more drivers for rural cities to meet demand.
2. Raise ride prices for urban cities to maximize profits.
3. Lay off drivers in urban cities to  since total drivers far exceeds number of total rides.
